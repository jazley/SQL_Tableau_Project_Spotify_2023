<br />

In this project, we dug into a dataset showcasing the famous tracks of 2023, straight from Spotify's charts. This dataset goes beyond the usual dataset of streaming platform, containing a load of fields. It provides insights into each song's attributes, popularity, and presence on various music platforms. The dataset includes information such as track name, artist(s) name, release date, Spotify playlists and charts, streaming statistics, Apple Music presence, Deezer presence, Shazam charts, and various audio features.

To make sense of all this data, we split the data into two tables, each with the relevant field for effective data analysis. After performing data cleaning, we dove into some quick data exploration once everything was all set for analysis. Finally, we brought it into Tableau to sprinkle its magic and jazz things up with data visualizations.

### Audience
